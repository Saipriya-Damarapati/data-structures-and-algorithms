Stable vs Unstable sort
------------------------------
* Concept while dealing with duplicate elements in the array

* Stable sort: Relative order of duplicate elements is preserved even after sorting; eg. stable_sort.png
* Unstable sort: Relative order of duplicate elements is not preserved after sorting; eg. unstable_sort.png

* Bubble sort is a stable sort, because we are not swapping the two adjacent elements when they are actually equal
