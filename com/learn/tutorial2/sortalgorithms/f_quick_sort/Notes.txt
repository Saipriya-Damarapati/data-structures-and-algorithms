Quick Sort
-----------------
* Divide and conquer algorithm similar to merge sort
* Recursive algorithm
* Uses a pivot element to partition the array into two parts
* Elements < Pivot to its left and Elements > Pivot to its right
* Pivot will then be in its correct sorted position

* Process is repeated for the left and right sub arrays
* Eventually, every element has been the pivot, so every element will be in its correct sorted position
* As with merge sort, we will end up partitioning the array into a series of 1-element arrays
* Does this in-place (unlike merge sort)

Performance
---------------
* In place algorithm
* Worst case - O(nsquare) quadratic time complexity
* Average case - O(n logn) logarithmic time complexity
* Most cases performs better than merge sort
* Unstable algorithm - because of moving the elements back and forth
* Choice of pivot can have effect on time compleixty
