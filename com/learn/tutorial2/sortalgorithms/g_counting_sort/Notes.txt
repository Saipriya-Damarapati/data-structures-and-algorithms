Counting Sort
-------------------
* Makes assumptions about the data
* Don't use any comparisons
* Cunts the number of occurrences of each value
* Only works with non-negative discrete values (can't work with floats, strings)
* Values must be within a specific range

Algorithm:
* Assume we have values between 1 and 10 inclusive
* We have 10 possible values, so we create a counting array of length 10
* Traverse the input array from left to right
* Use the counting array to track how many of each value are in the input array - Counting phase
* Use the counts in the counting array, write the values in sorted order to the input array

Performance:
* Not an in-place algorithm - create a counting array
* O(n) - can achieve this, because we are making the assumptions about the dtaa we are sorting
* If we want the sort to be stable, we have to do some extra steps, will be discussed in next section
* Range has to be nearly same as the number of elements we need to sort
