Lists
------------
* List is an Abstract Data Type (ADT)
* List is not a concrete data structure like array
    (Array dictates how the data is organized as a continuous block of memory,
        and also every element in the array has to occupy the same amount of memory)

Abstract Data Type (ADT)
--------------------------
* Does not dictate how data is organized
* Dictates what operations can be performed like access
* ADT is more about the behaviour not the data itself
* Concrete data structure is a concrete class
* Abstract data type is usually a class
