Vectors:
----------------------
* Vector is a ThreadSafe array list; it is Synchronized
* Synchronization is overhead to the system and it slows down, hence array list was introduced into jdk without synchronization
* Most of the operations on vector are synchronized (insert, remove, get operations are synchronized)
* Both array list and vectors return iterator and listIterator, both these iterators are FAIL-FAST iterators
* In case, array list or vector are structurally modified after iterators are created,
    then they throw ConcurrentModificationException
