LinkedList in Java
---------------------
* Doubly linked list implementation
* Implements List and Deque interfaces
* Non synchronized and not thread safe
* In case, linkedlist is structurally modified after iterators are created,
    then they throw ConcurrentModificationException
* Methods to add at the first and last positions are available (addFirst, addLast)
* add method adds an element at the end of the list (add is same as addLast)
* LinkedList by itself is a data structure
* JDK's linkedlist class extends AbstractSequentialList (which provides few methods implementation)
* Methods to remove, we have removeFirst and removeLast
* remove method by default removes the first element in the list
